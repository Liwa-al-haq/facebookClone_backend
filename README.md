# Facebook Clone Backend

This project is a backend implementation of a Facebook clone using Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Next.js with Next Authentication. It provides the necessary functionality and API endpoints to support the core features of a social media platform.


## Technologies Used

- Java Spring Boot: A powerful Java framework for building web applications and APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A robust open-source relational database management system.
- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered web applications.
- Next Authentication: An authentication library for Next.js applications.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your machine.
- PostgreSQL: Install and set up PostgreSQL database.
- Node.js: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

### Installation
